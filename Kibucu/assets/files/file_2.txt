The Introductory Rites

1. When the people are gathered, the Priest approaches the altar with the ministers
while the Entrance Chant is sung.
When he has arrived at the altar, after making a profound bow with the
ministers, the Priest venerates the altar with a kiss and, if appropriate, incenses the
cross and the altar. Then, with the ministers, he goes to the chair.
When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest and the faithful, standing, sign
themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest, facing the people, says:
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
The people reply:
Amen.
2.
Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people, saying:
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Spirit
be with you all.
Or:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Or:
[Greeting5Pub]
The Lord be with you.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.

Penitential Act *

Then follows the Penitential Act, to which the Priest invites the faithful, saying:
Brethren (brothers and sisters), let us acknowledge our sins,
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.
A brief pause for silence follows. Then all recite together the formula of general
confession:
I confess to almighty God
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have greatly sinned,
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,
And, striking their breast, they say:
through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault;
Then they continue:
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,
all the Angels and Saints,
and you, my brothers and sisters,
to pray for me to the Lord our God.
The absolution by the Priest follows:
May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins,
and bring us to everlasting life.
The people reply:
Amen.

listen.
To indicate the end of the reading, the reader acclaims:
The word of the Lord.
All reply:
Thanks be to God.

THE ORDER OF MASS
13. There follows the Alleluia or another chant laid down by the rubrics, as the
liturgical time requires.
14. Meanwhile, if incense is used, the Priest puts some into the thurible. After this,
the Deacon who is to proclaim the Gospel, bowing profoundly before the Priest, asks
for the blessing, saying in a low voice:
Your blessing, Father.

The Priest says in a low voice:
May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips,
that you may proclaim his Gospel worthily and well,
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
The Deacon signs himself with the Sign of the Cross and replies:
Amen.

If, however, a Deacon is not present, the Priest, bowing before the altar, says
quietly:
Cleanse my heart and my lips, almighty God,
that I may worthily proclaim your holy Gospel.

15. The Deacon, or the Priest, then proceeds to the ambo, accompanied, if
appropriate, by ministers with incense and candles. There he says:
The Lord be with you.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.

The Deacon, or the Priest:
A reading from the holy Gospel according to N.
and, at the same time, he makes the Sign of the Cross on the book and on his
forehead, lips, and breast.
The people acclaim:
Glory to you, O Lord.

Then the Deacon, or the Priest, incenses the book, if incense is used, and
proclaims the Gospel.
16. At the end of the Gospel, the Deacon, or the Priest, acclaims:
The Gospel of the Lord.
All reply:
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

THE ORDER OF MASS

Then he kisses the book, saying quietly:
Through the words of the Gospel
may our sins be wiped away.
17. Then follows the Homily, which is to be preached by a Priest or Deacon on all
Sundays and Holydays of Obligation; on other days, it is recommended.
18. At the end of the Homily, the Symbol or Profession of Faith or Creed, when
prescribed, is either sung or said:

An alternate musical setting of the Creed may be found in Appendix I, pp.
0000-0000.
I believe in one God,
the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.
I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God,
born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us men and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
At the words that follow up to and including and became man, all bow.
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
and became man.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
to judge the living and the dead
and his kingdom will have no end.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.


10
THE ORDER OF MASS
I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
and the life of the world to come. Amen.
19. Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during Lent and
Easter Time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’
Creed, may be used.
I believe in God,
the Father almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
At the words that follow, up to and including the Virgin Mary, all bow.
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried;
he descended into hell;
on the third day he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.

20. Then follows the Universal Prayer, that is, the Prayer of the Faithful or Bidding
Prayers.
The Liturgy of the Eucharist
21. When all this has been done, the Offertory Chant begins. Meanwhile, the
ministers place the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on
the altar.
22. It is desirable that the faithful express their participation by making an offering,
bringing forward bread and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist and perhaps
other gifts to relieve the needs of the Church and of the poor.
23. The Priest, standing at the altar, takes the paten with the bread and holds it
slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice:


THE ORDER OF MASS
11
Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the bread we offer you:
fruit of the earth and work of human hands,
it will become for us the bread of life.
Then he places the paten with the bread on the corporal.
If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words
aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:
Blessed be God for ever.
24. The Deacon, or the Priest, pours wine and a little water into the chalice, saying
quietly:
By the mystery of this water and wine
may we come to share in the divinity of Christ
who humbled himself to share in our humanity.
25. The Priest then takes the chalice and holds it slightly raised above the altar with
both hands, saying in a low voice:
Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the wine we offer you:
fruit of the vine and work of human hands,
it will become our spiritual drink.
Then he places the chalice on the corporal.
If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words
aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:
Blessed be God for ever.
26. After this, the Priest, bowing profoundly, says quietly:
With humble spirit and contrite heart
may we be accepted by you, O Lord,
and may our sacrifice in your sight this day
be pleasing to you, Lord God.
27. If appropriate, he also incenses the offerings, the cross, and the altar. A Deacon
or other minister then incenses the Priest and the people.
28. Then the Priest, standing at the side of the altar, washes his hands, saying
quietly:
Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.


12
THE ORDER OF MASS
29. Standing at the middle of the altar, facing the people, extending and then joining
his hands, he says:
Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters),
that my sacrifice and yours
may be acceptable to God,
the almighty Father.
The people rise and reply:
May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands
for the praise and glory of his name,
for our good
and the good of all his holy Church.
30. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer over the Offerings, at the
end of which the people acclaim:
Amen.


THE EUCHARISTIC PRAYER
31. Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer.
Extending his hands, he says:
The Lord be with you.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.
The Priest, raising his hands, continues:
Lift up your hearts.
The people:
We lift them up to the Lord.
The Priest, with hands extended, adds:
Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
The people:
It is right and just.
The Priest, with hands extended, continues the Preface.
At the end of the Preface he joins his hands and concludes the Preface with the
people, singing or saying aloud:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

116. It is not permitted to change the Preface of this Eucharistic Prayer because of
the structure of the Prayer itself, which presents a summary of the history of
salvation.
V.
R. The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.
V.
R. Lift up your hearts.
We lift them up to the Lord.
V.
R. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
It is right and just.
It is truly right to give you thanks,
truly just to give you glory, Father most holy,
for you are the one God living and true,
existing before all ages and abiding for all eternity,
dwelling in unapproachable light;
yet you, who alone are good, the source of life,
have made all that is,
so that you might fill your creatures with blessings
and bring joy to many of them by the glory of your light.
And so, in your presence are countless hosts of Angels,
who serve you day and night
and, gazing upon the glory of your face,
glorify you without ceasing.
With them we, too, confess your name in exultation,
giving voice to every creature under heaven,
as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
117. The Priest, with hands extended, says:
We give you praise, Father most holy,
for you are great
and you have fashioned all your works
in wisdom and in love.
You formed man in your own image
and entrusted the whole world to his care,EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IV
33
so that in serving you alone, the Creator,
he might have dominion over all creatures.
And when through disobedience he had lost your friendship,
you did not abandon him to the domain of death.
For you came in mercy to the aid of all,
so that those who seek might find you.
Time and again you offered them covenants
and through the prophets
taught them to look forward to salvation.
And you so loved the world, Father most holy,
that in the fullness of time
you sent your Only Begotten Son to be our Saviour.
Made incarnate by the Holy Spirit
and born of the Virgin Mary,
he shared our human nature
in all things but sin.
To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation,
to prisoners, freedom,
and to the sorrowful of heart, joy.
To accomplish your plan,
he gave himself up to death,
and, rising from the dead,
he destroyed death and restored life.
And that we might live no longer for ourselves
but for him who died and rose again for us,
he sent the Holy Spirit from you, Father,
as the first fruits for those who believe,
so that, bringing to perfection his work in the world,
he might sanctify creation to the full.
118. He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says:
Therefore, O Lord, we pray:
may this same Holy Spirit
graciously sanctify these offerings,
He joins his hands
and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together,
saying:

for the celebration of this great mystery,
which he himself left us
as an eternal covenant.
119. In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly
and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires.
For when the hour had come
for him to be glorified by you, Father most holy,
having loved his own who were in the world,
he loved them to the end:
and while they were at supper,
He takes the bread
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
he took bread, blessed and broke it,
and gave it to his disciples, saying,
He bows slightly.
T AKE THIS , ALL OF YOU , AND EAT OF IT ,
FOR THIS IS MY B ODY ,
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU .
He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and
genuflects in adoration.
120. After this, he continues:
In a similar way,
He takes the chalice
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
taking the chalice filled with the fruit of the vine,
he gave thanks,
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:

121. Then he says:
The mystery of faith.
And the people continue, acclaiming:
We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
Or:
When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
Or:
Save us, Saviour of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free.
122. Then, with hands extended, the Priest says:
Therefore, O Lord,
as we now celebrate the memorial of our redemption,
we remember Christ’s Death
and his descent to the realm of the dead,
we proclaim his Resurrection
and his Ascension to your right hand,
and, as we await his coming in glory,
we offer you his Body and Blood,
the sacrifice acceptable to you
which brings salvation to the whole world.
Look, O Lord, upon the Sacrifice
which you yourself have provided for your Church,
and grant in your loving kindness
to all who partake of this one Bread and one Chalice
that, gathered into one body by the Holy Spirit,
they may truly become a living sacrifice in Christ
to the praise of your glory.
Therefore, Lord, remember now
all for whom we offer this sacrifice:
especially your servant N. our Pope,
N. our Bishop, * and the whole Order of Bishops,

To all of us, your children,

There, with the whole of creation,

in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honour is yours,
for ever and ever.
The people acclaim:

Then follows the Communion Rite, p. 000.The Communion Rite
124. After the chalice and paten have been set down, the Priest, with hands joined,
says:
At the Saviour’s command
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:
He extends his hands and, together with the people, continues:
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Or:

125. With hands extended, the Priest alone continues, saying:
Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,
that, by the help of your mercy,
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,
as we await the blessed hope
and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
He joins his hands.
The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming:
For the kingdom,
the power and the glory are yours
now and for ever.
126. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud:
Lord Jesus Christ,
who said to your Apostles:
Peace I leave you, my peace I give you;
look not on our sins,38

but on the faith of your Church,
and graciously grant her peace and unity
in accordance with your will.
He joins his hands.
Who live and reign for ever and ever.
The people reply:
Amen.
127. The Priest, turned towards the people, extending and then joining his hands,
adds:
The peace of the Lord be with you always.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.
128. Then, if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds:
Let us offer each other the sign of peace.
And all offer one another a sign, in keeping with local customs, that expresses
peace, communion, and charity. The Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or
minister.
129. Then he takes the host, breaks it over the paten, and places a small piece in the
chalice, saying quietly:
May this mingling of the Body and Blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ
bring eternal life to us who receive it.
130. Meanwhile the following is sung or said:
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,
grant us peace.
Or:
The invocation may even be repeated several times if the fraction is prolonged.
Only the final time, however, is grant us peace said.
131. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly:

who, by the will of the FatherTHE ORDER OF MASS

keep me always faithful to your commandments,
and never let me be parted from you.
Or:
May the receiving of your Body and Blood,
Lord Jesus Christ,
not bring me to judgement and condemnation,
but through your loving mercy
be for me protection in mind and body
and a healing remedy.
132. The Priest genuflects, takes the host and, holding it slightly raised above the
paten or above the chalice, while facing the people, says aloud:
Behold the Lamb of God,
behold him who takes away the sins of the world.
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.
And together with the people he adds once:
Lord, I am not worthy
that you should enter under my roof,
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.
133. The Priest, facing the altar, says quietly:
May the Body of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life.
And he reverently consumes the Body of Christ.
Then he takes the chalice and says quietly:
May the Blood of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life.
And he reverently consumes the Blood of Christ.
134. After this, he takes the paten or ciborium and approaches the communicants.
The Priest raises a host slightly and shows it to each of the communicants, saying:
The Body of Christ.
The communicant replies:
Amen.40

And receives Holy Communion.
If a Deacon also distributes Holy Communion, he does so in the same manner.
135. If any are present who are to receive Holy Communion under both kinds, the
rite described in the proper place is to be followed.
136. While the Priest is receiving the Body of Christ, the Communion Chant begins.
137. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest or a Deacon or an
acolyte purifies the paten over the chalice and also the chalice itself.
While he carries out the purification, the Priest says quietly:
What has passed our lips as food, O Lord,
may we possess in purity of heart,
that what has been given to us in time
may be our healing for eternity.
138. Then the Priest may return to the chair. If appropriate, a sacred silence may be
observed for a while, or a psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may be sung.
139. Then, standing at the altar or at the chair and facing the people, with hands
joined, the Priest says:

Even more, by your Spirit you move human hearts
that enemies may speak to each other again,
adversaries may join hands,
and peoples seek to meet together.
By the working of your power
it comes about, O Lord,
that hatred is overcome by love,
revenge gives way to forgiveness,
and discord is changed to mutual respect.

and who always walk with us on the journey of life.
Blessed indeed is your Son,
present in our midst

and when, as once for the disciples, so now for us,
he opens the Scriptures and breaks the bread.

He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says:
Therefore, Father most merciful,
we ask that you send forth your Holy Spirit

distinctly, as the nature of these words requires.
On the day before he was to suffer,
on the night of the Last Supper,
He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

In a similar way, when supper was ended,

Then he says:
The mystery of faith.
And the people continue, acclaiming:
We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
Or:
When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
Or:
Save us, Saviour of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free.
7.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says:
Therefore, holy Father,
as we celebrate the memorial of Christ your Son, our Saviour,
whom you led through his Passion and Death on the Cross
to the glory of the Resurrection,
and whom you have seated at your right hand,
we proclaim the work of your love until he comes again
and we offer you the Bread of life
and the Chalice of blessing.
Look with favour on the oblation of your Church,
in which we show forth
the paschal Sacrifice of Christ that has been handed on to us,
and grant that, by the power of the Spirit of your love,

among the members of your Son,
in whose Body and Blood we have communion.
Bring your Church, O Lord,
to perfect faith and charity,
together with N. our Pope and N. our Bishop, *
with all Bishops, Priests and Deacons,
and the entire people you have made your own.
Open our eyes
to the needs of our brothers and sisters;
inspire in us words and actions
to comfort those who labour and are burdened.
Make us serve them truly,
after the example of Christ and at his command.
And may your Church stand as a living witness
to truth and freedom,
to peace and justice,
that all people may be raised up to a new hope.
Remember our brothers and sisters (N. and N.),
who have fallen asleep in the peace of your Christ,
and all the dead, whose faith you alone have known.
Admit them to rejoice in the light of your face,
and in the resurrection give them the fullness of life.
Grant also to us,
when our earthly pilgrimage is done,
that we may come to an eternal dwelling place
and live with you for ever;
there, in communion with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,
with the Apostles and Martyrs,
(with Saint N.: the Saint of the day or Patron )
and with all the Saints,
we shall praise and exalt you

through Jesus Christ, your Son.

The people acclaim:
Amen.
